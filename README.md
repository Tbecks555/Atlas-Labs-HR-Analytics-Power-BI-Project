# Atlas-Labs-HR-Analytics-Power-BI-Project

## Overview
In this project, I built a detailed HR analytics report using a fictitious dataset from a tech company called Atlas Labs. The main focus was to help the HR team easily monitor key employee metrics through clear, interactive visuals. Beyond just reporting, I also explored the data to uncover factors driving employee attrition, so the team could understand where improvements were needed to boost employee retention and keep top talents engaged.


## Objectives
1️⃣ Develop an interactive HR report using data from Atlas Labs to track key employee metrics.

2️⃣ Enable the HR team to easily monitor workforce trends and performance indicators.

3️⃣ Identify and analyze factors that influence employee attrition to support better retention strategies.

4️⃣ Provide data-driven insights that help Atlas Labs make informed HR and management decisions.
