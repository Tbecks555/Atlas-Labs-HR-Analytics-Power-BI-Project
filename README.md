## Overview

In this project, I built a detailed HR analytics report using a fictitious dataset from a tech company called Atlas Labs. The main focus was to help the HR team easily monitor key employee metrics through clear, interactive visuals. Beyond just reporting, I also explored the data to uncover factors driving employee attrition, so the team could understand where improvements were needed to boost employee retention and keep top talents engaged.


## Objectives

1️⃣ Develop an interactive HR report using data from Atlas Labs to track key employee metrics.

2️⃣ Enable the HR team to easily monitor workforce trends and performance indicators.

3️⃣ Identify and analyze factors that influence employee attrition to support better retention strategies.

4️⃣ Provide data-driven insights that help Atlas Labs make informed HR and management decisions.


## Tools and Methodology

* Power Query: Cleaned, prepared, and transformed raw HR data to ensure accurate, error-free analysis.

* Power BI: Designed interactive dashboards and clear visualizations to present key employee metrics and trends.

* DAX: Built calculated columns and measures to analyze employee attrition, track workforce KPIs, and uncover relationships between different HR factors.


## Key Insights and Visuals

## Insights

* Atlas Labs has an overall attrition rate of 16.1% — which implies about 1 in 6 employees leaving the company.

* The workforce is young — most active employees are between 20–29, which means fresh energy but also the need for stronger early-career support and growth opportunities.

* The White ethnic group has the highest average salary ($115,317), slightly above Native Hawaiian and Black/African American groups — highlighting why pay equity reviews matter.

* The Sales – Sales Rep role has the highest attrition rate at 39.8%, showing that sales teams need more support to stay engaged and motivated.

* Frequent travel and heavy overtime stood out as big churn drivers — pointing to workload balance as a key area for improvement.

* Employees with 1–2 years of tenure churned the most, showing how critical it is to get onboarding and early engagement right.

## Recommendations

**1. Invest in Career Development for Young Talent**

With the majority of the workforce aged between 20–29, it’s essential to implement robust early-career programs. Structured learning paths, regular upskilling opportunities, and transparent promotion pipelines can boost retention and unlock long-term value from this energetic but experience-hungry group.

**2.Conduct Regular Pay Equity Audits Across All Demographics**

The observed salary disparities, particularly the higher average compensation for White employees, underscore the need for proactive pay equity analysis. Implement annual compensation audits, paired with transparent communication on salary bands and raise criteria, to foster a culture of trust and fairness.

**3. Reinforce Support Structures for Sales Representatives**

With a 39.8% attrition rate, the Sales – Sales Rep role clearly requires urgent attention. Provide these employees with clearer expectations, achievable targets, regular performance feedback, and personalized incentives. Equally important is creating a team culture that emphasizes recognition and psychological safety.

**4. Balance Workload by Reducing Excessive Travel and Overtime**

High travel frequency and overtime are key churn contributors. Reevaluate workload distribution and consider policies like hybrid client meetings, task automation, and flexible work hours to ease pressure and promote employee wellbeing without compromising performance.

**5. Strengthen Onboarding and Mentorship for Early-Tenure Employees**

The first two years are a flight risk zone — especially for new hires. Introduce structured onboarding experiences, assign experienced mentors, and schedule regular check-ins throughout an employee’s first 18–24 months. Early engagement creates long-term loyalty and deeper integration into company culture.
